# Space Mission Dashboard

"Just as the stars have always beckoned me with their mysteries, delving into the depths of data for my Space Mission Dashboards project ignites that same sense of wonder and curiosity within me."

This Power BI project, delves into the fascinating world of space mission and it covers historical space mission records from 1957 to 2022, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes key details such as mission dates, rocket names, companies, locations, mission statuses, and more, providing a rich history of space exploration. 
 
About the Dataset:
 
The dataset encompasses over six decades of space missions, offering insights into the evolution and achievements of various space programs worldwide.
With nine columns, the data covers:
Company: The name of the company responsible for the mission.
Location: The geographical location of the launch.
Date: The date when the mission was launched.
Time: The specific time of the launch.
Rocket Name: The name of the rocket used in the mission.
Mission Name: The name of the mission.
Rocket Status: The operational status of the rocket (e.g., retrieved, active).
Price: The cost associated with the mission (note: this column has significant missing values).
Mission Status: The outcome of the mission (successful or failed).

Dashboard Overview:- My Power BI dashboard is divided into four detailed pages:

1. Mission Overview: Highlights total missions, successful missions, unsuccessful missions, and top companies by mission count.

2. Success-Failure Analysis: Examines mission outcomes, identifying key trends and success rates over the years.

3. Company and Rocket Performance: Analyzes the performance of various rockets and companies, highlighting the most prolific and successful ones.

4. Geographic Analysis: Visualizes mission launch sites and compares the contributions of different countries to space exploration.

Benefits and Insights:

This analysis provides valuable insights into the history and progress of space exploration, helping to:
* Identify the most successful companies and rockets in space history.
* Understand the trends in mission success and failure over time.
* Recognize the key countries contributing to space exploration.
* Discover patterns and anomalies in mission outcomes.
  
I'm thrilled with the insights gained from this project and the potential applications for future space research and analysis. Feel free to check out the detailed visualizations and insights in my dashboard!
